# Javascript-Quiz-C4

## Description
In this challenge, we were tasked to create a JavaScript quiz, as well as a page that saves and displays the results of the quiz. The quiz was fairly open-ended, so the questions were up to us. A timer is also required to finish the quiz, and if the timer hits 0 the quiz is supposed to end. If a question is answered incorrectly, the timer subtracts ten seconds. At the end of the quiz, users were asked to input their name or initials to save their score. The score of the quiz is supposed to be the amount of seconds left remaining on the timer. Once done, all of the scores that had been saved were displayed. In this submission, I am still having a couple of errors that need to be overcome: <ul>
<li>There are only 2 questions. However, the JavaScript allows for questions to easily be added without changing the functionality of the code when determining score or how long the quiz is.</li>
<li>Once the timer hits 0, the quiz does not automatically stop. It waits for a click input and then stops.</li>
<li>The scores page is not formatted.</li>
<li>The scores page also does not display from the highest score to the lowest score with corresponding names.</li>
</ul>
